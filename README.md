# Semantic Segmentation of Roads in satellite imagery. 

Semantic segmentation is the process of classifying each pixel of an image into distinct classes using deep learning. This aids in identifying regions in an image where certain objects reside. 

This aim of this project is to identify and segment roads in satellite imagery. Detecting roads can be an important factor in predicting further development of cities, and this concept plays a major role in GeoArchitect (A project which I started). Segmentation of roads is important to map-based applications and is used for finding distances or shortest routes between two places.

## 1. Dataset

For this challenge, I used the Massachusetts Roads Dataset. This dataset contains satellite images, along with the target masks. For convenience, I downloaded the dataset from academic torrents, and you can find the link here.

Both the masks and the images are 1500x1500 in the resolution are present in the .tiff format.

## 2. Manipulating the data
I did the following manipulations to data:
